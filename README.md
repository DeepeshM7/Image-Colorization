# Image-Colorization
This is an ongoing project and is to be updated.

# Baseline Architecture
We have made a simple U-Net architecture employing first two layers of ResNet50 network(pre-trained on imagenet) as Encoder.
</br>
In the decoder section we have used Upsampling layers to avoid checkerboard artifacts.
